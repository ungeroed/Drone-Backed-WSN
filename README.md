The repository contains the following directories:

- `SoundTest`: Android app for for doing sound pressure level experiments.
- `arduino`: Arduino code for doing sensor measurements.
- `computer_vision`: Code related to the computer vision homing primitive
including the automatic and hybrid approaches as well as utility applications.
- `drone`: MAVProxy based code for interacting with UAV as well as code for
communicating with Arduino.
- `measurement_analysis`: Tools for doing analysis on sensor measurements.
- `ros`: ROS based code for interacting with the UAV.
- `simulation`: Simple simulation framework.
- `socatting`: Scripts for tunneling TTY device over TCP.
